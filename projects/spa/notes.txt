ideas for placeb.io
	add a time function and volume controls
	easy goals:
		make the arrow change to reflect the state of the slide
		add the menu popout for the hamburger
		make a While loop for while on === true, to keep the animation going



	streach goals:
		Add optional background tracks such as rain or kittens :)
			Have the view background change to reflect the background track
				For rain, I could use a paralax raidrop sort o background
				For kittens, animated paralaxed pawPrints?
				not the beez nick cage easter egg
