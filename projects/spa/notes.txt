ideas for placeb.io
	add a time function and volume controls
	easy goals:
		make the arrow change to reflect the state of the slide
		add the menu popout for the hamburger
		make a While loop for while on === true, to keep the animation going



	streach goals:
		Add optional background tracks such as rain or kittens :)
			Have the view background change to reflect the background track
				For rain, I could use a paralax raidrop sort o background
				For kittens, animated paralaxed pawPrints?
				not the beez nick cage easter egg 600 and 620 sounds like bees


for the jive dynamic animation function i need to do these things
	1: make a fn in my srvc that will take in an element and a number
	2: use a loop to set the height of the current element using nth(child)
